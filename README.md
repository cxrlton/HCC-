Untangling the Challenges of Novice Minecraft Players: Navigating the Early Game without Tutorials

Abstract:
This case study delves into the experiences of five novice Minecraft players navigating the early game without instructions or tutorials. Through single 35-minute desktop gameplay sessions and post-session interviews, the study uncovers the challenges faced by players and their dependence on external assistance. Drawing from grounded theory analysis, the findings illuminate the hurdles novices encounter, particularly in understanding crafting mechanics and navigating the game world. These insights offer implications for tutorial design and game studies.
